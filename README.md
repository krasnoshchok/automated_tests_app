"# automated_tests_cmd_app" 

This is just an example of an effective command line app. You can add here what ever features you need

The app expects you to have your projects saved in the folder like:
APPS_FOLDER=D:/input_folder

You should set it in .env.

So your project names in the folder APPS_FOLDER must begin with ID followed by underscore, like "145_MyProject"

So during the stage of chosing the project, you can only write the ID of your App, so that you can do further
tests
